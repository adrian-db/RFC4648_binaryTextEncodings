RFC4648_binaryTextEncodings
===========================

iOS Base64 encoder and decoder.

A little project to implement a base 64 encoder and decoder, as described in RFC 4648 - and to test it using the
test vectors from the RFC.

I might expand this to include other base 64 alphabets, and possibly other encodings - and make it into a proper
library. Right now though, it serves as a central place to maintain and test the code, which I copy into projects that
need it.

Getting Started
===============

It isn't intended for anyone to use but me - but the place I start is with the unit tests - test the project in XCode,
and see how the tests do things.
